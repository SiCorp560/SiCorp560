## My name is Simon Corpuz
I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, studying in the Master of Science in Public Policy and Management: Data Analytics (MSPPM-DA) program. I previously graduated from CMU with a major in Information Systems, and minors in both Game Design and Human-Computer Interaction.
